Filter Toolbars
---

Adds a textile or markdown filter to admin textareas using Control.TextArea [http://livepipe.net/projects/control_textarea/] which was used in Frog CMS [http://www.madebyfrog.com/]

If the Paperclipped [http://github.com/kbingman/paperclipped] asset manager is installed then the image button will launch the Assets Bucket.


###Installation

To install the toolbars, just run 
 
	rake production radiant:extensions:filter_toolbars:update

This installs the javascripts, images and css.
